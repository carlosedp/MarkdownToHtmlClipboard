# MarkdownToHtmlClipboard

Sublime Text 3 package to convert a markdown document to RTF and place result on the Clipboard. I use this so I can create all my notes in MD format and easily paste to a Word document or Outlook email.

To use it, search for "Convert Markdown to HTML and copy to Clipboard as RTF" on command palette.

Tha package depends on Markdown Preview package (https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Markdown%20Preview).

This is still untested on Mac and Linux. To use on Windows, you need Powershell 5.1 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616).
